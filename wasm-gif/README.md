<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]]()

While web assembly is still not being used commonly and lacks mainstream adoption, more and more big players silently adopt it. Also in the developer community it seems to slowly but steadily gain traction.

As a developer I am keen to learn and expand my knowledge with new architectures and technologies. With web assembly the power of backend services using cpu-heavy load often even written in different hardware-near languages like C can be made available to the web. This revolutionizes the usage of the web and paves its path for even complex computer native apps to further along move into the browser.

Not being depending on a computational heavy backend means that files and resources also don't have to be sent over the internet improving speed, security and user experience. On top of that web assembly services can be offered completely offline for most use cases.

So the benefit of this technology is pretty obvious and downside like low adoption, low number of libraries is something that will disappear over time if this trending technology will prove oneself.







### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
